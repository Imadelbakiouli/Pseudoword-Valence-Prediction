# Pseudoword Valence Prediction
This project investigates whether form–meaning mappings learned from Dutch valence norms can predict the emotional valence of English pseudowords.

Multiple regression models were evaluated using character n-grams, fastText embeddings, and RobBERT representations. Model performance was assessed in-sample and on unseen pseudowords using Spearman correlation.
